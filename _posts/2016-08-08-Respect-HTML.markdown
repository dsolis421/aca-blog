# Respect HTML's Athoritai!

I must admit, over the years, I've never taken HTML seriously.  I knew enough to use an HTML editor, when provided by an app or a website. I could struggle through creating a full web page, that's *after* a few trips to [Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com/ "Stack Overflow") and [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/ "W3Schools").  Still, I never really gave it much respect.  

Call it arrogance, but I figured I knew the basics and what else is there to know?
+ It's the DNA of a web page
+ HTML *elements* make up a web page through strategically placed *tags*.
+ It's easy to use.

I also understood some of the code:
+ Headers, defined by their various `<h#></h#>` tags.
+ Paragraphs, defined by `<p></p>` tags.
+ Divs, or blocks, defined by `<div></div>` tags.
+ In-line styling attributes define the look of your elements.

Enter ACA and [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/ "Code Academy"). My whole outlook on HTML has changed. I was so fixated on learning CSS, Javascript, PHP, etc., that I never stopped to understand the role of HTML in true web development.  Nothing happens on a web page without it - no matter what you code elsewhere. I also never realized the true creative potential of HTML, as it pertains to web design.

I've had to revisit all my preconceptions about HTML.
+ It's the DNA of a web page - *It IS the web page.*
+ HTML *elements* make up a web page through strategically placed *tags*. - *What is the Box Model?*
+ It's easy to use. - *It's easy to mess up.*
+ Headers, defined by their various `<h#></h#>` tags. - *What is an `<hr>` tag?*
+ Paragraphs, defined by `<p></p>` tags. - *What is a `<pre></pre>` tag?*
+ Divs, or blocks, defined by `<div></div>` tags. - *What are semantic elements?*
+ In-line styling attributes define the look of your elements. - *Noob!*

If the rest of my learning experience at ACA is as eye-opening as this.  I'm in for a real treat. There's a reason that HTML is first on the curriculum.  It all starts with HTML.  Respect that!
